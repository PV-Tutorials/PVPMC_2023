Notes:
"a. This average year summary is useful for summarizing the climate at a particular location, especially non-irradiance parameters such as albedo and precipitation."
"b. Average year data alone are not suitable for PV simulations. Please use typical year or time-series data as the primary weather data input for PV simulations."
"c. The average year totals will not exactly match the typical GHI and DNI year totals (TGY and TDY files)."
"d. For more information on how typical year files are created, see https://www.solaranywhere.com/resources/satellite-data-methodology/."
"e. Soiling losses are calculated using the full historical SolarAnywhere time-series data. Soiling losses provided by SolarAnywhere represent atmospheric or regional soiling. Actual soiling losses may vary significantly—even within a single PV plant—due to highly location-specific conditions, such as particulates from nearby agricultural activity or trees. You can learn more about the state of validation and application for these data at https://www.solaranywhere.com/support/solar-energy-modeling-services/soiling-loss-modeling/"
"f. Snow losses are calculated using the full historical SolarAnywhere time-series data. Modeling of trackers does not include dynamic snow shedding available with some environmentally-aware tracking systems. For more information on how snow loss estimates are generated and applications for this data, visit our support center here: https://www.solaranywhere.com/support/solar-energy-modeling-services/snow-loss-modeling/"
"g. Snow and soiling loss simulation outputs may change as there are updates to the PV simulation."
"h. For this simulation: azimuth = 180 degrees, relative row spacing = 2.9, fixed-tilt, tilt = 40 degrees."
