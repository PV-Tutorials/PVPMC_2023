    <p><b>IMPORTANT – READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY BEFORE USING SOLARANYWHERE DATA. “DATA” SHALL MEAN THE INFORMATION PROVIDED OR RELAYED TO THE LICENSEE VIA ANY METHOD, INCLUDING THE SOLARANYWHERE APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE (API), VIA DOWNLOAD OR ACCESS DIRECTLY VIA SOLARANYWHERE.COM, OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED IN ANY FORM, INCLUDING PERSISTED OR STORED DATA OR COPIES THEREOF IN DIGITAL, ELECTRONIC, HARDCOPY OR OTHER FORMAT AND WHETHER IN HUMAN READABLE OR NON-READABLE FORMS.</b></p>
    <p><b>PROTECTION OF PROPRIETARY RIGHTS</b></p>
    <p>The Licensee acknowledges that pursuant to this Agreement it obtains only the right to use the Data consistent with this Agreement and that no right, title, or interest in or to any copyrights, trademarks, or other proprietary rights relating to the Data is transferred or licensed from Clean Power Research to Licensee.</p>
    <p>Licensee shall not remove, alter, cover, or disguise any acknowledgements, copyright notice, trademark, or other proprietary rights notice placed by Clean Power Research on the Data or any portion thereof. Licensee shall comply with directions submitted by Clean Power Research from time to time regarding the form and placement of proprietary rights notices on the product, or any portion thereof.</p>
    <p><b>1. Disclaimer</b></p>
    <p>THE DATA ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS”, “AS AVAILABLE” AND “WITH ALL FAULTS” BASIS. NEITHER CLEAN POWER RESEARCH NOR ANY OF ITS OFFICIALS NOR EMPLOYEES MAKES ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FOR THIS INFORMATION, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, NON-INTERFERENCE, ACCURACY OF INFORMATIONAL CONTENT, OR ARISING FROM A COURSE OF DEALING, LAW, USAGE, OR TRADE PRACTICE, ARE HEREBY EXCLUDED TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW AND ARE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED BY CLEAN POWER RESEARCH.</p>
    <p>The information is collected from various sources and will change over time without notice. Clean Power Research and its officials and employees assume no responsibility or legal liability for the accuracy, completeness, reliability, timeliness, or usefulness of any of the information provided nor do they represent that the use of any of the information will not infringe privately owned rights. While Clean Power Research endeavors to provide a usable, complete and high-quality irradiance data stream, events can occur in the generation of SolarAnywhere data that are beyond the control of Clean Power Research. For instance, the satellite platforms—upon which SolarAnywhere relies for imagery and other remote sensing data and which are operated by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)—could become nonfunctional or be damaged or destroyed, interrupting the flow of imagery into SolarAnywhere and the consequent generation of irradiance measurements. Thus, data could be missing from SolarAnywhere or in error. In such cases, Clean Power Research actively monitors remediation efforts by NOAA or other active parties and may take additional steps to provide supplemental data to customers. Clean Power Research will make a best effort to communicate relevant outages or issues it becomes aware of directly to customers.</p>
    <p>The information is not intended to constitute advice nor is it to be used as a substitute for specific advice from a licensed professional. You should not act (or refrain from acting) based upon the information without independently verifying the information and, as necessary, obtaining professional advice regarding your particular facts and circumstances.</p>
    <p><b>2. Grant of License</b></p>
    <p>Clean Power Research grants You a nonexclusive, nontransferable license to use the Data with which this license is distributed, within the entity You represent, and to make backup copies of the Data provided that: (i) all applicable copyright notices, and “readme” files(s) are maintained with the Data; and (ii) You agree to be bound by the terms of this License Agreement. The Data shall be used only by You, for your own personal or internal business use and not for distribution.</p>
    <p><b>3. Ownership</b></p>
    <p>You have no ownership rights in the Data. Rather, You have a license to use the Data as long as this License Agreement remains in full force and effect. Ownership of the Data and all intellectual property rights therein, if any, shall remain at all times with Clean Power Research.</p>
    <p><b>4. Copyright</b></p>
    <p>The Data may contain material that is protected by the United States Copyright Law and by international treaty provisions. All rights not granted to You herein are expressly reserved by Clean Power Research. You may not remove any proprietary notice of Clean Power Research from any copy of the Data.</p>
    <p><b>5. Permitted Uses</b></p>
    <p>You may use only the Data or subset thereof for which You have paid the required fees. You may use the Data internal to the entity You represent subject to the restrictions outlined below.</p>
    <p>You are responsible for all license fees through the subscription period plus any fees for usage exceeding the pre-paid amount. For example, if 200 locations were licensed over the subscription period but 300 were accessed using the API, You would be responsible for the fees associated with the incremental 100 locations via a true-up invoice. You are also responsible for any usage associated with your access keys or credentials beyond the dates of the subscription period.</p>
    <p>If You or the entity You represent are engaged in the creation or modification of studies, reports or analyses performed as a paid or unpaid service for a third party, You may use the Data in the course of performing the calculations necessary for the studies, reports or analyses subject to the restrictions outlined below. However, if You intend to relay or deliver the Data in whole or in part to a third party and not maintain the Data or any subset thereof within the entity You represent, You shall contact Clean Power Research as outlined below to request a license transfer, which Clean Power Research may or may not provide at its sole discretion. Upon execution of a license transfer, You shall permanently destroy any copies of the Data maintained or stored within the entity You represent.</p>
    <p>If You or the entity You represent intend to relay or deliver the Data in whole or in part to a third party and maintain the Data or any subset thereof within the entity You represent then the third party shall purchase a separate license for the Data in advance of any delivery by You to the third party, however Clean Power Research maintains sole discretion on purchase and license eligibility: Clean Power Research may choose not to license the Data to the third party. This requirement extends to programs, software or services for solar simulation and/or for the graphical interpretation, display, visualization or rendering of the Data.</p>
    <p><b>6. Restrictions</b></p>
    <p>You shall not sell, rent, lease, publish, post, license, lend, assign, timeshare, or transfer in whole or in part, or provide unlicensed third parties access to prior or present versions of the Data without the written consent of Clean Power Research. Clean Power Research shall be the sole and final arbiter on the license status of any entity or individual. No part of this restriction should be construed to disallow the creation of studies, reports or analyses so long as the Data is not transferred in whole or in part to an unlicensed third party and so long as the other conditions in this agreement, including the benchmarking restriction in this section are met. However, results or analyses relayed to a third party shall not allow for the derivation or reverse engineering of the Data in whole or in part.</p>
    <p>You shall not publish, transmit or communicate any competitive comparison, analysis or “benchmarking” of the Data without the prior written consent of Clean Power Research. Published or posted analysis based in whole or in part on the Data must reference Clean Power Research® and SolarAnywhere® as part of the final work.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, You shall not make use of the Data or derivatives thereof in whole or in part in internal or external processes that involve the exploration, creation or development of any products that could be considered —at the sole discretion of Clean Power Research—as competitive offerings to SolarAnywhere or any other existing product or service licensed or sold by Clean Power Research. This includes, but is not limited to, solar irradiance forecasting, solar installation siting or equipment quoting tools and renewable energy or utility program management tools or systems.</p>
    <p><b>7. Limitation of Liability</b></p>
    <p>You can recover from Clean Power Research only direct damages up to an amount equal to the fees You have paid to us for the Data for one year. Neither party can recover consequential, lost profits, special, indirect, incidental or punitive damages.</p>
    <p>This limitation applies to any claim arising under this Agreement, including without limitation, anything related to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li style="list-style-type: none;">
            <ul>
                <li>the Data and the service through which it is obtained,</li>
                <li>content on third party Internet sites, third party programs or third party conduct,</li>
                <li>viruses or other disabling features that affect your access to or use of the Data or the service through which it is obtained,</li>
                <li>incompatibility between the Data and other data, services, software and hardware,</li>
                <li>delays or failures You may have in initiating, conducting or completing any transmissions or transactions in connection with the Data in an accurate or timely manner, and</li>
                <li>claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>It also applies even if:</p>
    <ul>
        <li style="list-style-type: none;">
            <ul>
                <li>this remedy does not fully compensate a party for any losses, or fails of its essential purpose; or</li>
                <li>a Party knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to You to the extent limited by state law.</p>
    <p><b>8. Termination</b></p>

You may terminate this Agreement at any time by destroying or returning to Clean Power Research all copies of the Data in your possession or under your control, including backup and archival copies.
